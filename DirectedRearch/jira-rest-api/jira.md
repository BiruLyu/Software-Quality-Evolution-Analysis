# Introduction

## What is JIRA?

Jira is an angile project management tool and it's also an issue tracker.
Because of its extreme flexibility and the ability to merge these two things together it's one of the most powerful tools for team based productivity to get your team working together.

# Terms and Concepts in Agile 

## what is agile?

Agile is a team based project management methodology. 

There's two methods of working with agile in JIRA:

+ **Kanban**  "billboard"
  "lean" or "just-in-time"

  | TO-DO | In Progress | Complete |
  |:------|:------------|:---------|

+ **Scrum** "team working together to get something achieved"

  | Backlog | To-Do | In Progress | Complete |
  |:--------|:------|:------------|:---------|
  
## What is Sprint in Scrum?

+ A Sprint is a set of period of time (commonly 1 to 4 weeks)
    + To start a sprint, the team meets with scrum board open:
      It is essentially to have a cyclical nature of having a point to checking in to see where the progress is.
    + Two main questions are typically asked:
      - What went well in the last sprint?
      - What can we improve on for the next sprint?
    + Go through tickets to determine and agree on what will get accomplished in the next sprint
    + Sprints are essentially a determined
+ Daily Stand-up
    + First thing every morning(before emails), the team gathers
    + Each team member answer three questions:
      - What did I accomplish yesterday?
      - What will I do today?
      - What roadblocks do I foresee to stop me from accomplishing my goal?
      
## Kanban VS Scrum

| Kanban | Scrum |
|:---|:---|
| Work is tracked on a board that everyone can see | Work is tracked on a board that everyone can see |
| Ongoing work, meaning there's no sprints | Work is broken up into sprints |
| | Daily stand-ups each morning |

## User stories and Epics

### What are stories?

+ A story in agile is actually "user story"
+ In development, a user story is user-focused development
+ Formula for a user story:
  As a **[ROLE]**, I want **[DESIRE]** so that **[BENEFIT]**
  
### What is Epic?

As you might image, some user stories might take a while to finish
An epic is essentially a large user story that needs multiple sprints to complete
To accomplish an epic, break it into smaller user stories.
