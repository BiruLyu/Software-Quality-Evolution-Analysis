* ### What is REST?

* ### What the Resolution is? 

  If once that workflow has been completed so if you say complete the task but maybe it's something that it's a bug that you know you are not going to fix. 

   The status might be completed but the **resolution** would be we're not going to fix this as opposed to the status to be completed, but  the **resolution** being we fix this.
